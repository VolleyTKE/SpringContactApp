# README work in progress
# SpringContactApp
A Spring Contact App Tutorial.

I completed this tutorial provided here: 
https://github.com/VikramThakur8/SpringContactApp

During which I add some of my own features and changes. I have used this as a reference for my own spring based app that I am developing. 


# Environment Setup

Download install tomcat 8.5
During installation keep all settings. On the configuration window add a username and passwword; add ", manager-script, admin"
provide the appropriate jre for your version of java.

Add that server into your IDE environment. 


Download and install MySQL
during install the information used for db connections is in the file:
https://github.com/VolleyTKE/SpringContactApp/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cvg/capp/config/SpringRootConfig.java

You will have to either edit this properties or adjust your db to follow suite.
Import the capp.db file into MySQL. the db will setup with the appropriate schema and table. 

After cloning the project, open in it in your IDE, and perform a clean build. Lastly run the project. Please let me know if you have any problems. I will be posting issues as I think of new things to try in order to update this project.
